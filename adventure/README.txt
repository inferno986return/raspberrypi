The Abandoned Farmhouse Adventure is a text adventure game in the
spirit of similar games that ran on 8-bit microcomputers of the 1970s
and 80s or the more ambitious Colossal Cave adventure that originally
only ran on mainframes and minicomputers.

The plot and game should be self-explanatory. Figuring it out is the
point of the game.

The source is included and under an Apache license so you can modify
and adapt the code if you wish. Much of the code is data-driven and
could be used to implement an entirely different adventure just by
changing the map, strings, and some of the logic that handles special
actions.

Oh and by the way, the farm described here is based on a real
farmhouse where my father lived many years ago, right down to the
layout of most of the rooms. And I also have grandson who was
almost 3 years old at the time I wrote this.
